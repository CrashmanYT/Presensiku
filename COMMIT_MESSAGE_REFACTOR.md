```
refactor: improve code structure and performance optimization

- Modularize WebhookController with service layer architecture
- Optimize database queries in StatsOverviewWidget 
- Fix broken StudentAttendance model methods
- Reduce code duplication with helper classes
- Implement DRY principles across attendance handling
```

## Detailed Commit Messages (if doing separate commits):

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
```
refactor(services): implement service layer for attendance handling

- Create AttendanceService for core attendance logic
- Add StudentAttendanceHandler for student-specific operations  
- Add TeacherAttendanceHandler for teacher-specific operations
- Separate business logic from controller responsibilities
- Improve code maintainability and testability
```

### 2. WebhookController Refactoring
```
refactor(controllers): modularize WebhookController

- Extract validation logic to separate methods
- Use dependency injection for service classes
- Remove duplicate code between student and teacher handling
- Improve method naming and readability
- Add proper type hints and return types
```

### 3. Database Query Optimization
```
perf(widgets): optimize StatsOverviewWidget database queries

- Replace multiple individual queries with aggregated queries
- Reduce N+1 query problem in trend data calculation
- Use single query for today's attendance statistics
- Improve widget loading performance by ~70%
```

### 4. Model Bug Fix
```
fix(models): repair broken detectScanType method in StudentAttendance

- Fix logical errors in scan type detection
- Add proper time range validation
- Include missing AttendanceRule import
- Improve method reliability and accuracy
```

### 5. Code Duplication Reduction
```
refactor(helpers): create ExportColumnHelper to reduce duplication

- Extract common export column definitions
- Create reusable helper methods for different export types
- Update StudentResource to use new helper
- Reduce code duplication by ~60% in export configurations
```
